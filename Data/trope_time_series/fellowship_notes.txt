Details
- 3h49m
- Extended edition

Notes
- The list of tropes was cleaned to have about 400 individual trope occurences
- The tropes spearated at the end were not clear enough to locate
- Start Time and End Time entered as HH.MM.SS
- Tropes occurring briefly or within a second where given a 1 second duration
- Data added includes: the significant part of the story (sig_scene); book_movie_weirdness are tropes that you might want to exclude because it references something occurring in the book that is different in the film and hard to pinpoint the duration of; and cells containing descriptions of many occurences were exploded into individual occurences (more data points)
- TV Tropes entries for the wrong LOTR film were deleted
- TV Tropes mentioning a difference from book to film adaptation are at the bottom but un-timed
