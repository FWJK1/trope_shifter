The '90s," An odd but valid example — the whole movie seems really dated looking back, but at the time it was made, nobody dressed or talked like the characters in Clueless . The movie influenced the '90s, not the other way around. It should be noted that some of the clothing, specifically the looks sported by the teen guys, is still relevant and prevalent as of The New '10s .",No,No,Whole Movie,Yes,No,0,5833,,
Actually Pretty Funny," Even though Heather's his girlfriend (at the time) and he's been engaged in Snark-to-Snark Combat with Cher up to this point in the movie, Josh laughs at Cher's line about how she remembers who said ""To thine own self be true"". (see Shout-Out to Shakespeare below).",,,,,,2661,2669,,
Adaptation Title Change, Clueless is loosely based on Emma .,No ,No,Whole Movie,Yes ,No,0,5833,,
Adaptational Angst Downgrade," The scene in which Cher carelessly offends Lucy with her ""I don't speak Mexican"" comment and is chided by Josh is a loose, and much less serious, equivalent to the pivotal scene from Emma in which Emma publicly insults Miss Bates at the picnic and is sternly reprimanded by Mr Knightley. However, numerous other events, such as the failure of her driving test and her fight with Tai, collectively send Cher into the same inner turmoil that the events at the picnic induced for Emma.",No,No,,,,4302,4323,,
Adapted Out," Due to Christian being gay, there is no Jane Fairfax equivalent.",,,,,,3955,3989,,

Cue the gasps of many students gathered around the couple listening and Dionne shooting Murray an angry look.",,,,,,236,230,,
Alpha Bitch," Both Cher and Amber subvert this. Cher is rich, beautiful, and one of the most popular girls in school, but she doesn't act like a typical alpha bitch (though she is dismissive of Travis in the beginning). Amber does act like an alpha bitch, but a milder one, and Cher is higher on the high school social pecking order. Also, while the two snipe at each other, they don't seem to hate each other or try to destroy each other's lives.",,Yes,Whole Movie,,,0,5833,,

Artsy Beret," Josh briefly has a pretentious college girlfriend, who talks condescendingly about philosophy and wears a beret. She's not quite as intellectual as she thinks she is, as she mangles a Shakespeare quote that Cher knows correctly.",No,No,,,,2629,2669,,
"Aw, Look! They Really Do Love Each Other"," While most of the time Dionne and Murray are snapping at each other, Cher notes they really are affectionate with each other when they think no one's looking. Same with Josh and Cher, as most of the time when the two are bickering, neither can stand it when the other gets hurt. (Cher disapproves of Tai liking Josh because she likes Josh; Josh argues with a lawyer who insults Cher over a minor mistake.)",,,,,,4050,4070,,

Black Comedy," Travis seems to lead a depressing teenage life, though he faces it all with a smile . He tries to commit suicide when he sees the grades on his report card and cheerfully thanks his parents for never giving him a ride to school, hinting at either Parental Neglect or simply them not having the means to help their kid ride to school (or both).

She even wears a tuxedo to Mr. Hall and Ms. Geist's wedding at the end. Cher: And in the grand tradition of all gym teachers, Miss Stooger seemed to be same-sex oriented.",,,,,,702,709,,
Can't Take Criticism," Downplayed with Cher, who thinks grades are something to be negotiated, instead of a reason to improve her schoolwork.",,,,,,572,590,,
Captain Obvious," Cher helpfully explaining how to attract a boy's attention, and the reasoning behind her methods: Cher: Sometimes you have to show a little skin. This reminds boys of being naked, and then they think of sex.",,,,,,3037,3044,,
Clique Tour," Cher shows Tai the ropes of high school by showing her the cliques as they walk up to the school entrance. She points out the people who run the TV station, the ""Persian mafia"", and the popular boys before the conversation is derailed.",,,,,,1370,1400,,
Comically Missing the Point," Amber accuses Cher of talking about ""some little party"" instead of their assigned debate topic, but Cher points out that it was her dad's fiftieth birthday, which is hardly little. Travis thinking his record of getting to class late the most times is cause for celebration - complete with acceptance speech .",,,,,,323,338,,
Completely Off-Topic Report," Cher summarizes Haitian/American relations for her class debate this way (while mis-pronouncing it as Hay-ti-uns): So like, right now for example. The Haitians need to come to America. But some people are all, ""What about the strain on our resources?"" Well it's like when I had this garden party for my father's birthday, right? I put R.S.V.P. 'cause it was a sit-down dinner. But some people came that like did not R.S.V.P. I was like totally buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, and squish in extra place settings. But by the end of the day it was, like, the more the merrier. And so if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion may I please remind you it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of Liberty. Thank you very much.",,,,,,265,318,,
Distracted by the Sexy," Cher undoes her pigtails to get her hair down and Josh gets distracted, much to their lawyer's annoyance, and gets calle it.",,,,,,5220,5235,,
Don't Tell Mama," When Dionne finds out Murray is shaving his head at the party, she gets angry and tells him she's going to call his mother. Murray, who had been mocking her up to this point, immediately gets upset and pleads with her not to call his mother.",,,,,,2130,2145,,
Entitled Bastard," Elton, who Cher characterizes as a snob and a half after he says he couldn't date Tai because ""do you even know who my father is?""",,,,,,2476,2494,,
Erotic Eating," Cher does this eating chocolates she bought herself in order to make the guy she likes jealous. Cher: [narrating] Also, anything you can do to draw attention to your mouth is good.",,,,,,3030,3036, ,
Establishing Character Moment," In the first scene after the opening montage, we see Cher use a computer program to choose a suitably co-ordinated outfit for school, after which she heads to the kitchen and tries to persuade her dad to have a glass of orange juice with breakfast, reminding him that his doctor is concerned about his health. This establishes her as placing significant value on both personal appearance and the well-being of those she cares about, and it provides an early hint that she's not as shallow as she initially seems.",,,,,,61,127,,
Expy," Several characters, as the film is basically a Setting Update of Jane Austen's Emma . Cher is Emma Woodhouse. Josh is Mr. Knightley. Cher's father is Mr. Woodhouse. Tai is Harriet Smith. Christian is Frank Churchill. Travis is Robert Martin. Elton is Mr. Elton. Amber is Mrs. Elton. Ms. Geist is Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston. Mr. Hall is Mr. Weston.

Flirty Stepsiblings," Cher and Josh, who initially fight like siblings but end up getting together romantically. It helps that their parents are no longer married.",,,whole movie,,,480,5833,,
Foreshadowing," In his introductory scene, Christian (who's later revealed to be gay) stands in front of a sign saying ""End Discrimination."" In the scene where Cher is packing for her father and is surprised by Christian's call, he is at a museum; the painting behind him is of two men affectionately in an embrace, another foreshadow of his sexuality. The films that Christian watches on video with Cher, Some Like It Hot and Spartacus , provide clues to his sexual orientation. The first movie deals with cross-dressing men (who are escaping from a mob hit). The second includes the famous scene where a Roman master ( Laurence Olivier ) tries to seduce his male servant ( Tony Curtis ). The book Christian is reading during class, Junky by William S. Burroughs , is another clue and indication of his sexual orientation, as its author had strong homosexual desires. When Christian first appears at the class, Cher has new hopes for high school boys. However, as the shot pans from her gaze to him in the doorway, just over his left shoulder on the wall in the classroom is a cutout headline from the newspaper which reads, ""On the Road to Nowhere."" When Cher comes downstairs in her white Calvin Klein dress for her date with Christian, the Reaction Shot of her arrival is given to Josh and not Christian.",,,,,yes,2901,2904,,
Fourth-Date Marriage," Subverted. The scene where Cher and Josh admit their feelings for each other and kiss is immediately followed by a wedding scene... at which point, Cher's voice-over points out how gross it is for anyone to assume that it's her getting married, seeing as she's only sixteen and ""this is California, not Kentucky."" The wedding is actually for the teachers she set up earlier in the movie. Also serves as commentary on the reality of Austen’s times, where girls very much did get married at 16 after four ""dates.""",,Yes,,,,5442,5448,,

Geeky Analogy, Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.,,,,,,2862,2870,,
Geeky Turn-On, Tai and Travis bond over Marvin the Martian .,,,,,,1460,1495,,
The Glasses Gotta Go," Cher and Dionne give Mrs. Geist a speedy makeover that mostly consist of removing her glasses, tucking her shirt and fluffing her hair.",,,,,,1078,1095,,
Glad-to-Be-Alive Sex," Dionne and Murray do this after she almost gets into an accident while driving on the freeway. Cher: [voiceover] And that's when Dionne's virginity went from ""technical"" to ""non-existent"".",,,,,,4053,4065,,
Gone Horribly Right," At the beginning, Cher helps give Tai a makeover and attempts to make her ""fit in"" as one of the new popular girls.

Good Feels Good,When Cher smiles about doing good deeds after setting up tai and elton,,,,,,2275,2295, ,
Good Bad Girl," Most everyone, but especially Cher. The primary theme of the movie comes down to it being possible to be vapid, shallow, and even a little naughty (Cher is shown drinking and smoking a little at a party) while still having a good heart with good intentions.",no,no,whole movie,,,1680,5833,,
Good Feels Good," The premise is Cher coming to realize this. She starts out meddling in her teachers' love lives to schmooze them for better grades, then befriends the new girl she originally saw as a project. By the end, she volunteers to head a donation drive at school.",,,,,,4874,5833,,
Gossip Evolution," By the time news of Tai's incident gets back to Cher (who witnessed it), it's turned into an attempted gang execution.",,,,,,4152,1167,,

Hurricane of Euphemisms," When Murray is telling Cher that Christian is gay. Murray: Your man Christian is a cake boy! Cher & Dionne: A what? Murray: He's a disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde -reading, Streisand -ticket-holding friend of Dorothy , know what I'm saying?",,,,,,3961,3975,,
Hypocritical Humor," Lucy gets mad when Cher mistakes her for a Mexican (she's from El Salvador). After she storms out of the room, Cher comments to Josh that she doesn't see what the big deal is, and Josh says, ""You get upset if anyone thinks you live below Sunset.""",,,,,,4314,4322,,
Incompatible Orientation, Cher and Christian (as he's gay).,,,,,,3840,4100,,
Insistent Terminology," Tai: Cher, you're a virgin? Cher: You say that like it's a bad thing. Dionne: Besides, the PC term is ""hymenally challenged"". Cher: It's not like I'm a prude or anything. I'm just... highly selective.",,,,,,2775,2780,,
Instantly Proven Wrong," The moment Cher declares high school boys ""not boyfriend material"", Christian walks in. (Subverted because it does turn out he's not boyfriend material, at least not for a girl.) Tai enters a party and immediately falls down the stairs, and worries that everyone will think of her as the fall-down-the-stairs girl. Cher reassures her that no one even saw it, but is interrupted by a random guy asking Tai if she's okay, since that fall looked really bad.",,,,,,2871,2900,,
Irony," Josh claims he would ""die of shock"" if Cher ever did something that was less than 90% selfish, and she replies that that would be reason enough for her, making it 100% selfish no matter what it was.",,,,,,1020,1025,,
"It's Fake Fur, It's Fine"," Cher responds to Dionne's giving her a hard time about her fur purse: ""It's faux!""",,,,,,167,170,,

Kick the Dog," For accidentally screwing up the paperwork she helped her father label to ""September files"", one of the lawyers working for Cher's father gets mad and tells her to ""go back to the mall or something"". Cher leaves in tears and Josh berates the lawyer for doing that.",,,,,,5259,5268,,
Know-Nothing Know-It-All," Downplayed with Heather, who misquotes Shakespeare (""To thine own self be true"") only to be corrected by the thus-far ditzy Cher. The irony is that she was quoting Hamlet (with a totally un-nuanced interpretation thereof) in order to back up her (rather vocal) opinion on a subject.",,,,,,2628,2668,,
Leg Focus," At one point Christian compliments Cher on her ""nice stems"" after he ( and the camera ) get a nice look at them.",,,,,,2918,2928,,
Literal-Minded," Cher apparently thinks the rule to ""pause"" at intersections is about mentally pausing, and breezes through one without stopping.",,,,,,169,180,,
Longing Look," Tai shows one for Travis. Travis shows several for Tai when Cher tried to fix her up with Elton. Josh and Cher exchange these multiple times to each other without the other knowing, much to a lawyer's annoyance.",,,,,,2627,2665,,
Made of Iron, Tai is unfazed by her habit of falling and hitting her head at every party she goes to.,,,,,,2260,2275,,
The Makeover," Two. Tai gets a new outfit and hairstyle and somewhat of a new personal regime. Later, Cher decides to ""make over her soul"" and become a nicer person by getting involved in charity work.",,,,,,1550,1660,,
Missing Mom," Cher's mother died during a freak complication during a routine liposuction. Granted, Cher doesn't really remember her that much, although she does pretend her mother watches over her and greets the large picture of her at the front door. Josh also teases her about this being her motive for wanting to make over Tai and treat her like one of her dolls. There is one surprisingly touching scene where, when she's insecure that she isn't a good person, her father tells her he hasn't seen so much good-doing since her mother, which seems to greatly comfort her.",,,,,,448,462,,
The Monolith," Cher's phone, when she's waiting for Christian to call her back.",,,,,,3667,3675,,
Mood Whiplash," At one point, the narration of Cher's rather glum introspection on her feelings for Josh and how everything seems to be going wrong for her is suddenly interrupted when she notices some nice clothes in a store window . The house party starts out fun, switches to Dionne throwing a dramatic fit over her boyfriend Murray shaving his head, and then back to the fun again.",,,,,,4691,4693,,
,,,,,,,0,0,,
"My God, What Have I Done?"," When it's pointed out to Cher that she's genuinely done something wrong or crossed the line, she feels genuine guilt over it. For example, when she casually assumes that Lucy the family maid is from Mexico when she's actually from El Salvador, once it's sunk in that this is actually quite rude and offensive of her, she's genuinely apologetic.",,,,,,4326,4328,,
No Antagonist," The movie has no central antagonist. Amber, the character who butts heads with Cher and her friends the most, never outright tries to sabotage them at anything and isn't always wrong in her criticisms of Cher. A lot of the conflict or manipulation from the film comes from Cher's own well-meaning (or at least non-malicious) poor decisions. Elton and the mugger are certainly antagonistic, but only for brief scenes without much impact on the main story.",,,,whole movie,,1200,5833,,
Not Blood Siblings, Cher and Josh. Ex-stepsiblings in this case; Josh's mother and Cher's father had married and subsequently divorced each other when Cher and Josh were younger.,,,,,,486,504,,
Not Distracted by the Sexy," To his credit, the street criminal who robs Cher doesn't even look down when she shows him her dress, explaining that it's an Alia.",,,,,,2551,2555,,
"One Dialogue, Two Conversations"," Likely what happened with Heather, who was just trying to make a point about living the life you want to live. Heather: Excuse me, I think I remember Hamlet [the play] accurately. Cher: Well, I remember Mel Gibson accurately, and [Hamlet] (the character) didn't say that. That Polonius guy did.",,,,,,2628,2668,,
Parental Fashion Veto," Cher is about to head to a party (on a date with Christian) when Josh asks her dad if he's going to let her go out in what she's wearing, a white mini-dress. Cher's father asks her if that's what they're calling dresses these days, tells her it looks more like underwear and makes her put something on top. Which turns out to be a transparent wrap.",,,,,,3145,3172,,
Plot-Mandated Friendship Failure," When Tai expresses a crush on Josh and sees Cher's disapproval of it, she eventually snaps and says, ""Why should I take advice from you? You're a virgin who can't drive."" It's downplayed because Cher is obviously hurt; Tai immediately regrets saying that and they reconcile a few scenes later.",,yes,,,,4610,4635,,
Political Overcorrectness," Cher mockingly asks Amber if she prefers to be called ""ensemble-y challenged"". Dionne claims that being a virgin, and not just a technical virgin, is called ""hymenally challenged"".",,yes,,,,2019,2026,,
Pop-Cultural Osmosis Failure," When Cher and Josh are working on Mel's lawsuit. Josh: You look like Pippi Longstocking . Cher: You look like Forrest Gump . [ Beat ] Who's Pippi Longstocking? Josh: Uh, someone Mel Gibson never played .",,,,,,5210,5221,,
Previously Overlooked Paramour," Near the end of the movie, Cher realizes that she is in love with Josh, her idealist ""ex-stepbrother"", who is not afraid to call Cher out on her superficiality.",,,,,,4720,5833,,
Product Placement," Cher interrupts her voiceover with ""Ooh, Snickers ..."" when she's looking around the teacher's lounge. Also there are a few brands mentioned in the movie, such as Calvin Klein and Fred Segal, and the outfit Cher buys during her walk in Rodeo Drive is from Christian Dior, as seen later from her shopping bag. Cher is also seen with a Starbucks cup in few scenes. Diet Coke cans are seen multiple times during the film.",,,,,,698,700,,
Reconstruction," It's difficult to imagine now but the whole Teen Movie genre was moribund in the early '90s; Clueless was the first commercial and critical success in many years, perhaps because it was such an exuberant return to the optimism of the '80s genre films.",,,whole movie,,,0,5833,,
Reasonable Authority Figure, Mel Horowitz. He seems scary at first but is actually open-minded and understanding. It's also implied he's aware of Josh's crush on Cher and approves.,,,,,,4800,4892,,
Related Differently in the Adaptation," An unusual case in which the characters are technically no longer related. In Emma (upon which Clueless is loosely based), George Knightley is the brother of Emma's brother-in-law (her sister is married to his brother). In this film, Cher is an only child and the Knightley analog Josh is her ex-stepbrother (her father has since divorced his mother) who hangs around because he still has a good relationship with her dad.",,,,,,480,5833,,
Retail Therapy," Cher goes shopping whenever she's feeling down. This is actually used as a joke at one of the more serious parts of the movie, as she's mulling over how much of a mess she's unintentionally made of things while walking past a store. Cher's Inner Monologue: Oh, and this Josh-and-Tai thing was wiggin' me more than anything. I mean, what was my problem? Tai is my pal. I don't begrudge her a boyfriend, I really—ooh! I wonder if they have that in my size. [Cut to Cher walking home with a shopping bag, her monologue picking up as if nothing had happened.]",,,,,,4691,4693,,

"Savvy Guy, Energetic Girl", Cher and Josh - she always pushes him to go out and have fun.,,,,,,3370,3380,,
Setting Update," Of Emma . Most of the plot stays the same, except it gets rid of some of the Values Dissonance of the Jane Austen novel, such as the marriage focus (having the Frank Churchill stand-in, Christian, turn out to be gay rather than secretly engaged, for example) and the class issues. Cher lampshades the former difference when her Relationship Upgrade moment and kiss-fest with Josh flips straight to a wedding where she says, ""As if!
