Rule of Symbolism,"Jackson bows to Tolkien with subtle grace: the film opens in total darkness, and the voice of Cate Blanchett begins to speak... in Elvish.

Opening Monologue," Galadriel's now iconic opening monologue of the film, describing the forging of the Rings Of Power , the Battle of the Last Alliance, Sauron's downfall and the One Ring being lost and forgotten, basically laying the groundwork for the beginning of the main story. The page quote at the top is just part of it. She speaks some Elvish (Sindarin) at the beginning of the monologue. ""( I amar prestar aen. ) The world is changed. ( Han matho ne nen. ) I feel it in the water. ( Han mathon ned cae. ) I feel it in the earth. ( A han noston ned gwilith. ) I smell it in the air.

Distant Prologue," The movie starts with Galadriel narrating several crucial events leading up to the series. These include the creation of the Rings of Power (c. 4900 years ago), the War of the Last Alliance (c. 3000 years ago), and Bilbo Baggins taking the One Ring from Gollum (60 years ago).

Myth Prologue," The film opens with the story of how the rings of power were forged (effectively introducing the races of Middle Earth in the process), how Sauron used the One Ring of Power to take over Middle Earth, how Isildur failed to destroy the ring once Sauron was defeated, and how millennia would pass before it was fished out of the water once again. Galadriel, narrating, mourns that there are so few still alive who were there to witness it.

Delicious Distraction," During the extended version opening of the movie (well, second opening; during the Concerning Hobbits scene), a hobbit-maid is about to kiss her hobbit-lover, who is distracted by a basket of muffins going around and eats it instead. At the exact same moment, Bilbo narrates that ""a Hobbit's only true love is for food.""",,,,,,SHIRE,,571,574,
Punctuality Is for Peasants," When Gandalf the Grey meets up with Frodo Baggins on the way to attend the birthday party being thrown for Frodo's uncle Bilbo Baggins, Frodo accuses the wizard of being late, to which Gandalf retorts that he arrived when he planned to. Subverted and Played for Laughs , as Gandalf, who is a close friend of the Baggins, actually arrived just as the party was being set up, and both Frodo and Gandalf quickly break into laughter at the quip.

Actually Pretty Funny," When Gandalf arrives at Bag End and knocks on the front door, he expects a warm greeting from his old dear friend. Gandalf's instead greeted by the Hobbit (who doesn't realize who's knocking) yelling through the closed door and going on a very Bilbo-esque tirade about visitors, well-wishers, and distant relations. Gandalf just stares at the door throughout all this before chuckling. Even 60 years after the Quest of Erebor , Bilbo is still Bilbo.",,,,,,SHIRE,,937,955,
Forgot to Mind Their Head," This was a hazard both in and out of universe: During the scene where Gandalf visits Bilbo in his hobbit hole, Gandalf, stooping, accidentally backs into a chandelier (as part of the script). His actor Ian McKellen then promptly turns and accidentally smacks his head on the roof, an (unscripted) accident so funny that they left it in .",,,,,,SHIRE,,1000,1007,

Last Day of Normalcy," Bilbo's birthday party introduces us to all the characters of Hobbiton prior to their being thrust into their adventure, from gentle and thoughtful Frodo to loyal and simple Samwise, to the mischievous pair of Merry and Pippin (their role changed somewhat from the books, where they were more savvy to Bilbo's magic ring). This is a downplayed example, though, as while it does serve the purpose of showing the tranquility of Hobbiton, it isn't until Gandalf returns with confirmation of the nature of Bilbo's ring that Frodo is thrust out the door on an adventure.",,,,,End is when Frodo gets home after Bilbo's birthday party.,BIRTHDAY,,1208,2478,

Freeze-Frame Bonus," Peter Jackson points out on the DVD Commentary that if you're paying attention during the wide shots for Bilbo's birthday party speech, you'll realize that his birthday cake is melting. This was due to the polystyrene catching fire from the 111 candles (hence the smoke and glow on Ian Holm's face). But because Holm was on a roll, they kept shooting and cropped out the cake in post-production.",,,,,,BIRTHDAY,,1439,1440,

Audience Murmurs," Played for Laughs when Bilbo is giving his farewell and says, ""I don't know half of you half as well as I should like and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve."" This is straight out of the book where it describes the response as scattered applause with most of the audience working it out to see if it came out to a compliment. The movie conveys this reaction with mostly blank looks in the audience.",,,,,,BIRTHDAY,,1483,1489,
Offscreen Teleportation," Gandalf manages to move from Bilbo's party to Bag End before Bilbo himself gets there, even though he is seen sitting in the audience while Bilbo is running home, made invisible by the Ring. All without crossing paths with him, either. He is a wizard, but not even the most powerful beings in Middle-earth can manage actual teleportation.",,,,,,BIRTHDAY,,1557,1558,

Kill the Lights," When Gandalf intimidates Bilbo to convince him to leave the Ring behind, the room darkens and his voice gains a menacing reverberation.

Deathly Dies Irae," ""Dies irae"" appears in the score as Bilbo's ring tempts him one last time before he leaves the Shire.

",,,,,,BIRTHDAY,,1731,1746,
Aborted Arc," Bilbo's departure from the Shire is an in-universe example. Bilbo's intention for his retirement was to retrace his and the Company of the Dwarves' journey and revisit the familiar locales of his youth (Mirkwood, Lake-town, and Erebor). However, those travel plans were made before Bilbo relinquished the Ring (and without knowing it was actually responsible for his longevity).

Jump Scare," Gandalf knows something's wrong with the Ring that he had to pressure Bilbo into finally discarding, but he isn't entirely sure just what it's capable of as he reaches for it. The instant his fingers grace its metal, a hellish eye of fire appears with a screaming sound and a boom more akin to primordial thunder not even a quarter of a second.

Then the camera pulls back... and back... and back... until we are able to get a full view of the ungodly immense, dozens of times larger and infinitely more menacing tower that is the true Barad-dur, revealing the initial tower we saw as one of the hundreds of (relatively) tiny lookout towers spaced around Barad-dur's outer wall.",,,,,Not sure this is in the right spot.,RESEARCH-NAZGUL-COMING,,1931,1952,

He created it as an Amplifier Artifact that would make his already formidable Mind Control powers strong enough to take over the other rings (and through them, their wearers). But in making the Ring strong enough to control the other rings he had to put so much of his Life Energy into it that as long as the Ring survives he cannot be completely destroyed either.

Gollum is located and captured by Sauron's forces (and before Gandalf can get to him first) and tortured into divulging what he knows. This gives the Nazgul their first real lead on the One Ring's whereabouts since Sauron's original downfall.

All he had to do was say the elven word for ""friend"" and the door opened. Gandalf read the inscription aloud before, but in the common tongue, not in Elvish. He notes that the doors were made when trade between Moria and neighbouring Eregion was plentiful, and the dwarves of Moria would have little reason to close the gates, especially not to elves. The late third age, however, is far more dangerous, and people are more suspicious. Frodo: It's a riddle. ""Speak friend and enter."" What's the Elvish word for friend? Gandalf: Mellon .

Uncommon Time," The Uruk-Hai theme from Howard Shore's score, heard most prominently in the track ""Amon Hen"" on this film's OST, has 5/4 time. Shore explained that he was aiming to give Saruman's army a mechanical-sounding accompaniment.",,,,,,LURTZ-MISSION,,10416,10458,
Foreshadowing,"Aragorn realizes that they're being followed by Gollum, but says that he's ""too clever a waterman"" to catch. In The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King we see a flashback of Smeagol and Deagol pole-fishing from a boat, and Deagol proves to be a good swimmer. This bit in the Extended Edition also explicitly establishes that Gollum made out of Moria and is still on the Fellowship's tail. This sets up Gollum continuing to follow Frodo and Sam once they split off from the Fellowship and finally making his move at the beginning of the next film (something was only implied in the Theatrical Edition).",,,,,,RIVER TRAVEL,,10486,10491,

Poor Communication Kills," Zigzagged when Gandalf realizes Gollum's followed them into Moria.

If Frodo hadn't spotted Gollum by chance and reported it, the Fellowship would've remained unaware they were being trailed (since Gandalf would have taken that knowledge with him when he falls into the chasm ). But because Frodo sounded the alarm, Aragorn's now vigilant in the Extended Editon (and hoped they'd lose Gollum on the Anduin River).

Gandalf stops at Rohan in the first book before going to Rivendell, attempting to warn Theoden about Saruman's FaceâHeel Turn --- but Grima Wormtongue has already started poisoning his mind.
